Computational Statistical Mechanics Tutorials

A short list of things that I wish I had known when I started my Ph.D. work, in tutorial form.  While there are many excellent books form which to learn thermodynamics and statistical mechanics, active learners may benefit from these demos, which are based around re-usable example codes that can be extended to solve new research problems.  With this being said, the codes are not tested and might be incorrect; use/modify with caution.

Installation instructions are provided at https://sites.google.com/site/aaronskeys/resources/tutorials.  Most of the codes have compilation instructions in the comments at the top of the page.
